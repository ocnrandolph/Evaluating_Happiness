# Evaluating Happiness:  
## Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Techniques Exploring the Relationship Between Values and Wellbeing  
  
### Project Overview & Motivation  

I'm curious about the relationship between the values that people hold and the way they experience the world. For this project, I'll be analyzing individuals' values and their self-rated level of happiness. Data for this project come from the 6th wave of the World Values Survey, and were collected between 2010 and 2014. Although the analytical tools I'll be using are more often utilized for prediction tasks, I'll be using common ML techniques for discovery and inference. Since I value the "why" behind the patterns I observe, I play around with a few techniques to reduce dimensionality and gain interpretability.
